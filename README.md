# 🚀 Deep Learning Journey: From Pixels to Predictions

Welcome to my personal journey into the world of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Computer Vision**, and **Deep Learning**.

This repository is a hands-on, evolving record of everything I’m learning — from manipulating pixels with Python’s Pillow library to building neural networks that can make intelligent decisions from image data. Whether you're a beginner or just curious about AI, you're welcome to follow along!

## 🧠 Why This Journey?

As someone who's passionate about AI and healthcare, I wanted to go beyond just "running models" and truly understand **how machines see the world**.

Starting from basic image transformations, my goal is to:
- Build a strong foundation in vision and deep learning
- Work on real-world projects (e.g., health tech, image-based systems)
- Share everything I learn to help others grow too
